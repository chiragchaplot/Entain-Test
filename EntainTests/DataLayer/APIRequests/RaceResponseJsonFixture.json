          "race_comment_alternative": "SHESALLSHENANIGANS (4) looks the one to beat. She's racing in great form of late, a winner at Flemington three back and only beaten narrowly in two runs since, the latest behind in-form mare Bossy Nic in BM90 grade. That form looks very strong, she can take up a good spot and win this. DEEKAY (5) is very consistent but doesn't win many. He's placed in his past three, just behind SHESALLSHENANIGANS at Flemington last time out. SIR DAVY (2) was given time after a disappointing run in the spring and has had two trials in readiness for his resumption. Can play a role. Something for the Multiples: HIGHLAND GEORGE (8)"
